 It is measure goodness of our fit 
 The R-squared shows how much of the total variability of the dataset is explained by your regression model. This may be expressed as: how well your model fits your data. It is incorrect to say your regression line fits the data, as the line is the geometrical representation of the regression equation. It also incorrect to say the data fits the model or the regression line, as you are trying to explain the data with a model, not vice versa.

  The sum of squares total, denoted SST, is the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and its mean. 
  The second term is the sum of squares due to regression, or SSR. It is the sum of the differences between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable.
  the sum of squares error, or SSE. The error is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.
