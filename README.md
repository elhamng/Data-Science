 Introduction to Data Science
 
 Populations and Samples:
 
 A parameter is a characteristic of a population n e. g. , the average height of all Americans. \\
 A statistics is a characteristic of a sample n e. g. , the average height of a sample of Americans.
 
 Data based on types and measurement level, Data type is categorical and numerical.  Categorical data has categories or groups. Numerical data present numbers.  They show discrete or continuous.
 
 Data visualisation for categorical data : frequency distribution tables, bar charts, pareto diagram. 
 Data visualisation for Numerical  data :  Histogram: Depicts information from a frequency table or a grouped frequency table as a bar graph

 mean :  simple average : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /> for population and  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{x}" title="\bar{x}" /> for sample. It is easily affected by outliers.  
 
 Median  :  is the middle number in an ordered dataset.
 
 Mode:  value that occurs more often.
 
 Measure of symmetry: skewness indicates whether the data is concentrated on one side.

 ##What is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R^2" title="R^2" /> ? 

 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=R^2&space;=&space;\frac{variebility&space;explained&space;by&space;the&space;regression&space;}{total&space;variability&space;of&space;the&space;dataset}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R^2&space;=&space;\frac{variebility&space;explained&space;by&space;the&space;regression&space;}{total&space;variability&space;of&space;the&space;dataset}" title="R^2 = \frac{text{variebility explained by the regression} }{text{total variability of the dataset}}" /></a>
 
 It is measure goodness of our fit 
 The R-squared shows how much of the total variability of the dataset is explained by your regression model. This may be expressed as: how well your model fits your data. It is incorrect to say your regression line fits the data, as the line is the geometrical representation of the regression equation. It also incorrect to say the data fits the model or the regression line, as you are trying to explain the data with a model, not vice versa.

  The sum of squares total, denoted SST, is the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and its mean. 
  The second term is the sum of squares due to regression, or SSR. It is the sum of the differences between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable.
  the sum of squares error, or SSE. The error is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.

  Like the R-squared, the adjusted R-squared measures how well your model fits the data. However, it penalizes the use of variables that are meaningless for the regression.
  Almost always, the adjusted R-squared is smaller than the R-squared. The statement is not true only in the extreme occasions of small sample sizes and a high number of independent variables.

  
 ## What is ANOVA (analysis of variance)?
 
 Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study.
  ## What is F-statistics?
